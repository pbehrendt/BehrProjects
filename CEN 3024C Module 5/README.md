# Iteration vs Recursion Time Efficiency

This project acts as a test of which method is faster, Iterative or Recursive.

This will be tested by using the same inputs for both methods and having both doing a Fibonacci equation.
I recommend using all nonnegative integer numbers since the project is not set to properly receive negative numbers.
